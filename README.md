# Foreign-Object-Detection-on-X-rays
Developed a YOLO-based object detection model to identify foreign objects in chest X-rays, significantly reducing false positives in automated pulmonary disease screening. After evaluating both YOLOv5 and YOLOv6, YOLOv5 was selected for its superior performance and integrated to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability.
